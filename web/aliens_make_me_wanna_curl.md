**TASK** 

We are expecting communications from an artificial intelligence device called MU-TH-UR 6000, referred to as mother by the crew. We disabled the login page and implemented a different method of authentication. The username is mother and the password is ovomorph. To ensure security, only mothers specific browser is allowed.


In the task you get to information:

* User-Agent: MU-TH-UR 6000
* Credentials: mother:ovomorph

--> Put this into a curl command:
`curl -u mother:ovomorph -H "User-Agent: MU-TH-UR 6000" https://spooky-aliens-make-me-wanna-curl-web.chals.io/flag`

Flag:
`NICC{dOnt_d3pEnD_On_h3AdeRs_4_s3eCu1ty}`
