Task:
Great work finding the location of the photo!

While you were getting the location of the photo, we were able to decrypt the message.

Meet me for lunch. I'll be at my hotel nearby where the queen sits watching the snowy court.

Get us the name of the hotel and the restaurant so we can get there. It might be too late to see them, but we may be able to recover tapes, audio, or other evidence from the scene to figure out their plans.

Time's running out - so make sure you get it right when you send it to us... there aren't a lot of chances to mess this up.

flag format: NICC{The-Hotel-Name_Restaurant-Name}

NOTE: Only use the first part of the restaurant's name. After that seems to be a description that was recently added. Example: If it was at the holiday_inn and the restaurant was Sunshine a burger and bourbon car, you would write: NICC{The-Holiday-Inn_Sunshine}. Note, this is not correct and probably doesn't exist.

The description says:

`Meet me for lunch. I'll be at my hotel nearby where the queen sits watching the snowy court.`

We know we are in Washington DC, so I googled for "snowy court" and found the "Snows Court Street".
If you follow the street, you can see there is an intersection with the "Queen Annes" Street, so this seems to suit to the description.

If we now look at Google maps, we can see the restaurant and the hotel
